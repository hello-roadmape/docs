Roadmaps consist of views. Roadmaps allow you to see, organize and follow related views together.

Roadmaps can be thought of as acting as a folder for views.

Filter, sorting and display operations are all applied to views.

<Info>More detailed information about the views can be found on the [Views](/understanding-roadmaps-and-views/views). </Info>

## Creating roadmaps

<Note> You can duplicate or delete a roadmap by double clicking on it while on the roadmaps screen. </Note>
