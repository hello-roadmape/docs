There is no limit to how flexible the roadmap can be with views. 

For example, in one view you can view the roadmap in NNL format, while in the other view you can view it in a timeline view grouped by leads.

### Creating and Navigating Views

You can create views inside of the roadmap. Also you can edit and delete them.

You can create a new view and navigate between existing views by clicking the view button on the left of the filter button.

### Editing and Deleting Views

You can edit or delete a view with the 3-dot menu next to the comment button on the far right of the views.

<Note>
You can also do the following from the 3-dot menu:
- Duplicate the view 
- Copy the view link 
- See in full screen 
</Note>

### Saving Views

Views are separated from each other by Filter, Sorting and Display.

Apart from these three features, we can say that all views in a roadmap are the same.

Each view has its own filter, sorting and display. You can change these instantly, but unless you save, the view will return to the last saved state.

In this way, you will never disrupt the main roadmap view.

You can also create a new view with the filter, sorting and display you just performed, without disturbing the existing view by clicking **Save as new**.
