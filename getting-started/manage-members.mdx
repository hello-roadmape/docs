Members can be manually invited from the settings page or sidebar.

You must select a role for each member you invite.



In Roadmape, there are 4 roles: **Admin**, **Editor**, **Collaborator** and **Billing**.

<Note>Users whose roles are collaborator and billing are not included in the billing calculation.</Note>

### Admin
Admins are the people with the highest authority in the workspace. Only admins can invite new members and manage roles for other members.

### Editor

Editors cannot access Workspace settings, manage access, or invite new members.

Apart from these, editors can do everything admins can do.

### Collaborator

Roadmape doesn't include Colloborators in the workspace's billing.

### Billing

Roadmape doesn't include Billing users in the workspace's billing.
