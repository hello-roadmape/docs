Members can be manually invited from the settings page or sidebar.

You must select a role for each member you invite.

Additionally, members can be invited via an unique invitation link. When users sign up through this link, they will automatically be added to your workspace.

<Note>When a user joins via the invitation link, their role is editor. This can be changed at any time by Admins through settings.</Note>

In Roadmape, there are 4 roles: **Admin**, **Editor**, **Collaborator** and **Billing**.

<Info>Users whose roles are collaborator and billing are not included in the billing calculation.</Info>

### Admin
Admins are the people with the highest authority in the workspace. Only admins can invite new members and manage roles for other members.

### Editor
Editors cannot access Workspace settings, manage access, or invite new members.

Apart from these, editors can do everything admins can do.

### Collaborator
Collaborators do not have editing authority.

Roadmape doesn't include Colloborators in the workspace's billing.

### Billing

Roadmape doesn't include Billing users in the workspace's billing.
