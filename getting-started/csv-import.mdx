## Proper format for importing Roadmape

The .csv file might need to be updated a bit to import into Roadmape.

Due to Roadmape's hierarchy feature, you might have more than one item type in your workspace, so make sure your CSV file has a column for this.

You should also have a column for each item type's property.

<Note>If there is an error, you will be able to correct this error during import. But still, the more suitable the .csv file is for import, the easier the process will be.</Note>

Here's a sample CSV file you can download and update. [Download here](https://prod-roadmape-files.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/roadmapeStaticFiles/CSV_Import_Template.csv)
