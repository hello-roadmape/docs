## Adding Item Types to Hierarchy

Adding new item types is easy. Just create them, and place them wherever you like in the hierarchy. The item type above becomes the parent, and the one below becomes its child.

<Note>In order to use the item types in your workspace, you must add them to the hierarchy. The item types on the left cannot be used.</Note>

## Removing Item Types from Hierarchy

Removing an item type from the hierarchy hides its items from the workspace.

The parent and child links of an item of this type are broken too. Adding the item type back to the hierarchy doesn't reconnect them.

<Warning>The hierarchy must contain at least one Item Type. </Warning>

## Parent and Child Relationship

Imagine a scenario with three item types: **Objective**, **Epic**, and **Feature**. Let's use an example:

You have an Epic which named **Payment Integration** and there are **5 Feature** with associate with this Epic.

**The average of the status of these 5 features determines the status of the Payment Integration Epic**.

Let's also imagine that there is an **Objective** called **Increasing Revenue** and there are epics under it, one of these epics is Payment Integration.

**The status of the objective will be determined by the average of the epic statuses under this objective.**

<Note>An item can have multiple children but only one parent.</Note>

Top items are influenced by the bottom items in your hierarchy.

Using a well-established hierarchy, Roadmape manages status updates automatically, so you do not have to manually update every level.

<Warning>If you make changes to the product hierarchy, the progress will be recalculated, so exercise caution.</Warning>

<Note>The changes you make to the hierarchy will not be applied until you click the Update button. </Note>

Using Roadmape's hierarchy, you can seamlessly control your product development journey throughout the entire process. Simply organize, customize, and watch your workflow evolve as time goes on.
