An item in Roadmape contains information about your works, projects, tasks or whatever you're working on. 

A feature or an epic are the most common examples of items.

Items are similar to blocks in Notion. Basically, everything consists of an item, such as Views and Roadmaps.

They can contain dozens of data points such as lead, description, status, effort, and lots more.

<Info>More detailed information about the properties and other attributes of the items can be found on the [Item Type](/understanding-items/item-types).</Info>

## Create Items

- Use the keyboard shortcut `C` to open up the item creation pop-up.
- Use the `+ New Item` button at the sidebar.

<Note>The item is not created until clicking the create button in the item creation pop-up.</Note>

<Info>While creating an item in pop-up, you can change the item type at the top left.</Info>

<Info>To create more than one item at once, toggle the create more button in the pop-up.</Info>
